# Variant calling

## Description
Variant Calling identifies and characterizes genetic variations or variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions or deletions (indels), in DNA or RNA sequences. Several tools can be used for variant calling. [FreeBayes](https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes) was used for this analysis.

### Call variants

```
for sample in `cat sample_id.txt`
do
  freebayes -f ${ref.fasta} Mapping/${sample}.clean.bam  > Mapping/${sample}.vcf
done
```
