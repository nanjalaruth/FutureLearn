# Variant calling
Variant Calling identifies and characterizes genetic variations or variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions or deletions (indels), in DNA or RNA sequences. Several tools can be used for variant calling. I used FreeBayes for this analysis.

## Index reference file
```
samtools faidx ${ref}.fasta
```

### Call variants

```
for sample in `cat sample_id.txt`
do
  freebayes -f ${ref.fasta} -p 1 Mapping/${sample}.clean.bam  > Mapping/${sample}.vcf
done
```

### Zip and index variants

```
bgzip ${vcf_file}
tabix ${vcf_file}.gz
```
